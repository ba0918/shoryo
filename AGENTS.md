# Agent Instructions

## Core

- Serve the stated goal; do not widen the requested scope.
- Distinguish what is confirmed from what is inferred and what is unverified.
- After changing something, verify it by a means appropriate to the change.
- Do not perform irreversible, destructive, or externally visible actions without approval.
- Apply the project's own instructions where they are more specific than these.

Refer to each rule by its skill name. Read every rule that applies before starting the work it
governs. A rule once read stays in force for the rest of the context: read it again only after
the context has been compacted or cleared, or when the rule itself has changed. On a delegated
task, a rule the delegation prompt names as already inlined is in force from that prompt — do
not read it again; read every other rule this table routes to the work as usual.

## Project Context

Project-specific context — what this repository is, how to build and test it, and the
conventions that apply only here — lives in `PROJECT.md`. Read it before making changes.
